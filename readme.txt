Question 1:

Open iSPin, open the promela file, then go to verification, show advanced parameter settings, set them to physical memory: 1024, estimated state space size: 1000, maximum search depth: 10000

Run verification, it will say pan:1: invalid end state at depth 9987, to run the trail file, go to simulate/reply and run Guided with trail and fill in the trail file name (which should be PromelaModel.pml.trail)



For Question1 and Question2, to restore any of the sessions for the 2 isf files, click Restore Session at the top and select the isf file.

Restoring the isf file for Question1 will show the sequence of events which leads to the deadlock and the message sequence chart.

Restoring the isf file for Question2 will show the sequence of events for Question2 Part2.

Word docs showing the sequence of events for Q1 and Q2 are also in the folder, just in case restoration of the isf files fail.
